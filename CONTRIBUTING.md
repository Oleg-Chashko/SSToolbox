The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Shell Script Toolkit. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes.
## Feature Requests
Shell Script Toolkit is not accepting any new feature requests at this time, sorry. You can file a feature request for a feature that you plan to implement and submit a pull request for, so that the feature can be reviewed and you will know ahead of time if the feature will be rejected. 

## Bugs
Please search through the existing issues, open and closed, before filing a new bug.
Add the version of Shell Script Toolkit, the version of the OS, and screenshots or videos as necessary.
After reporting you should aim to answer questions or clarifications as this helps pinpoint the cause of the issue.

## Donations
I improve Shell Script Toolkit in my free time because I want to create something good for everyone to use. If you want you can donate your thanks and a star.
